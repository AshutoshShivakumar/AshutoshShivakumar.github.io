In this research article, we propose a human-AI teaming based mobile language learning solution that provides: 1.) automatic and accurate intelligibility analysis for multiple languages at various levels: sentence, phrase, word and phoneme; 2.) immediate feedback and multimodal coaching on how to correct pronunciation; and, 3.) evidence-based dynamic training curriculum tailored to each individual’s learning patterns and needs, e.g., typical pronunciation errors and retention of corrected pronunciation. The use of visible and interactive AI-expert technology capable of intuitive emoji-based interactions will greatly increase student’s acceptance and retention of learning with a virtual coach. In school or at home, it will readily resemble an expert reading specialist to effectively guide and assist a student in practicing reading and speaking by him/herself independently, which is particularly important for dual language learners (DLL) whose first language (L1) is not English as many of their parents don’t speak English fluently and cannot offer the necessary support. Our human-AI teaming-based solution overcomes the shortfall of conventional computer-based language learning tools and serves as a supportive learning platform that is critical for optimizing the language-learning outcomes.
