title: "Individualized Smart Charging to Mitigate the Growing Electrical Peak Demand from EVs as Home Appliances"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'In this paper we analyze the upcoming trends in electric vehicle (EV) to grid integration. We identify various challenges and opportunities that EVs present to the users and Utilities. Then, we present two progressively intelligent solutions for autonomous, cost efficient and sustainable charging of EVs to address the major problems due to EV charging at the individual, residence and grid levels. Our simulation study shows that the proposed smart charging solutions can effectively mitigate the potentially overwhelming peak demand challenge due to the synchronized charging activities. Therefore, leading to a win-win proposition for both the user and the Grid and
accommodating seamless integration of EVs as appliances into the Smart World.'
