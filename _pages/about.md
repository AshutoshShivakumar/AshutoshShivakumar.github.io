I am a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio working under the guidance of [Dr. Yong Pei](https://people.wright.edu/yong.pei) and [Dr. Nia S. Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nia-peters-50275836/).

I am inspired by real world problems and driven to solve using cost-effective and data-driven methods. My approach to research is defined by interdisciplinary collaboration, rigor and first principles based thinking.

As a bibliophile and music enthusiast I am fascinated by the power of written and spoken word in sparking our imagination and conveying information about the self. Hence, my research interests are in the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Linguistics, Discourse Analysis, Human Computer Interaction and Social Psychology. I am currently working on projects that involve developent of real-time, pragmatic information extraction techniques that leverage prosodic(How it is said?) and lexical(What is said?) information from conversations to identify emotions, speaker agreement/disagreement, speaker engagement and task boundaries.
